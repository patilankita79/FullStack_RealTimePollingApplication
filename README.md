# FullStack_RealTimePollingApplication
This is a full stack real time polling application. In this application the user will see votes on the front-end as they come in, so user doesn't need to refresh the browser periodically. For front-end, Canvas JS is used to display the result in charts and for backend NodeJS and express are used. Pusher API is used for real time subscriptions. When a vote is submitted to the server through the form, Pusher will trigger the response and update the front-end i.e. result will displayed in charts.
